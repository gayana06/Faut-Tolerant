Two bat files are available
-------------------------------
1. start.bat- this will start the processes without any delay.
2. start_with_delay.bat- this will add a delay when each process deliver the decision received from another process. Also in this scenario we have disabled the decesion delivery to the application by the process itself if it decides.
